	abstract = {In this work, we consider the potential of cometary impacts to deliver complex organic molecules and the prebiotic building blocks required for life to rocky exoplanets. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that for these molecules to survive, impacts at very low velocities are required. This work shows that for comets scattered from beyond the snow-line into the habitable zone, the minimum impact velocity is always lower for planets orbiting Solar-type stars than M-dwarfs. Using both an analytical model and numerical N-body simulations, we show that the lowest velocity impacts occur onto planets in tightly packed planetary systems around high-mass (i.e. Solar-mass) stars, enabling the intact delivery of complex organic molecules. Impacts onto planets around low-mass stars are found to be very sensitive to the planetary architecture, with the survival of complex prebiotic molecules potentially impossible in loosely packed systems. Rocky planets around M-dwarfs also suffer significantly more high velocity impacts, potentially posing unique challenges for life on these planets. In the scenario that cometary delivery is important for the origins of life, this study predicts the presence of biosignatures will be correlated with (i) decreasing planetary mass (i.e. escape velocity), (ii) increasing stellar-mass and (iii) decreasing planetary separation (i.e. exoplanets in tightly-packed systems).},

	abstract = {Hydrogen cyanide delivered by cometary impactors can be concentrated as ferrocyanide salts, which may support the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. One way to achieve the conditions required for a variety of prebiotic scenarios, requiring for example the formation of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene, is through the arrival of a secondary impactor. In this work, we consider the bombardment of the early Earth, and quantitatively evaluate the likelihood of origins scenarios that invoke double impacts. Such scenarios are found to be possible only at very early times ( > 4Gya), and are extremely unlikely settings for the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry, unless (i) ferrocyanide salts are stable on 1000yr timescales in crater environments, (ii) there was a particularly high impact rate on the Hadean Earth, and (iii) environmental conditions on the Hadean Earth were conducive to successful cometary delivery (i.e., limited oceanic coverage, and low ( $\lesssim$ 1 bar) atmospheric surface pressure). Whilst environmental conditions on the early Earth remain subject to debate, this work highlights the need to measure the typical lifetime of ferrocyanide salts in geochemically realistic environments, which will determine the plausibility of double impact scenarios.},

          abstract = {This work combines spectroscopic and photometric data of the polluted white dwarf WD 0141-675, which has a now retracted astrometric super-Jupiter candidate, and investigates the most promising ways to confirm Gaia astrometric planetary candidates and obtain follow-up data. Obtaining precise radial velocity measurements for white dwarfs is challenging due to their intrinsic faint magnitudes, lack of spectral absorption lines, and broad spectral features. However, dedicated radial velocity campaigns are capable of confirming close-in giant exoplanets (a few MJup) around polluted white dwarfs, where additional metal lines aid radial velocity measurements. Infrared emission from these giant exoplanets is shown to be detectable with JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and will provide constraints on the formation of the planet. Using the initial Gaia astrometric solution for WD 0141-675 as a case study, if there were a planet with a 33.65 d period or less with a nearly edge-on orbit, (1) ground-based radial velocity monitoring limits the mass to <15.4 MJup, and (2) space-based infrared photometry shows a lack of infrared excess and in a cloud-free planetary cooling scenario, a substellar companion would have to be <16 MJup and be older than 3.7 Gyr. These results demonstrate how radial velocities and infrared photometry can probe the mass of the objects producing some of the astrometric signals, and rule out parts of the brown dwarf and planet mass parameter space. Therefore, combining astrometric data with spectroscopic and photometric data is crucial to both confirm and characterize astrometric planet candidates around white dwarfs.},
