I am a PhD student in the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk). Previously, I studied Physics at the University of Oxford ([St Edmund Hall](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk)), and worked briefly as a Data Scientist.

My research focuses on the dynamics of small bodies in planetary systems, and the consequences of their impacts on the habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets. Recent <a href="#">work</a> has investigated Earth's 'late veneer', as recorded by the concentration of highly-siderophile elements in the mantle. For more details, please see my <a href="/publications/">publications</a>, or my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.

If you interested in any of my work, please feel free to get in touch!
